                    <p class="paragraph-text">Sri Lankan cuisine is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. <br>
                     The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut which is an ubiquitous plant throughout the country. <br>
                      Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Influences from Indian (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch cuisines are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring South and Southeast Asian cuisines.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-text">Since Sri Lanka is a multi cultural country, you cannot expect anything less when it comes to Sri Lankan food. Our country is filled with its regional flavours while the cuisine is known for a rich combination of rice specialities, spices, herbs, seafood, seasonal vegetables and fruits and of course, legumes. <br>
                        Culture plays a pivotal role in the food scene in Sri Lanka while many Sinhalese food items are derived from the chena cultivation. From the most celebrated and auspicious Sinhala and Hindu New Year to various day to day events and celebrations will see an array of traditional Sri Lankan meals ranging from milk rice, sweetmeats and spicy curries for accompaniments. <br>
                        Many of these dishes are centred around the main staple rice, rice flour and coconut while seafood also plays quite an important part in Sri Lankan cuisine. Most Sri Lankans prefer vegetable curries while the main go-to meal in any part of the island is the good old “Rice and Curry”. The curries have immense flavour and colours which are derived from a list of Sri Lankan Hot Spices. These spices not only add great flavour to the food but also adds ayurvedic value to the dish. <br>
                        Since Sri Lankan food is regionally diverse, you can expect the same dish prepared in various methods and with different flavours. For an example, the dishes from the South of Sri Lanka have a distinctive quality and is mainly amalgamated with seafood. “Ambulthiyal” is a unique spicy fish preparation that uses a thick gambooge (goraka) paste while the preparation in the South is different from the other parts of the island. <br>
                        Hot and Spicy, tangy and sweet are the main flavours that you can explore whenever you are on a food trail in Sri Lanka.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Hey there! I'm chalana nimsara</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-text">Herbs and spices have been a major influence on Eastern cuisine since times immemorial. Spices heighten the flavour and aroma of a dish. Currently, herbs and spices are valued beyond their rudimentary flavouring applications and see continued demand for various medicinal purposes. <br>
                    As the name 'Spice Island' implies, Sri Lanka is no stranger to the world of herbs and spices. In fact, it is no exaggeration to state that spices have influenced the cuisine and the taste buds of the local communities with their rich flavour profiles and aromatic properties. <br>
                    The 'Spice Island' came to be as a result of Sri Lanka's climatic conditions allowing for a variety of spices to be grown on the Island's soils. The abundance of these culinary treasures attracted the attention of many western nations throughout history who wished to source from Sri Lanka’s spice market.<br>
                    Today, Sri Lanka's spice economy continues to flourish having penetrated the foreign markets which can't help but be allured by the rich aroma of Sri Lankan spices. Sri Lanka supplies the international market with some of the most sought-after spices and allied products such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, cardamoms, nutmeg, mace and vanilla. Sri Lanka's spice exports have grown to amount to over 50% of all agricultural exports and continue to see upward trends as they find their way into the kitchens all over the globe. <br>
                    These are 12 major Herbs and spices found in Sri Lanka. <br><br>
                    <h2>CINNAMON</h2> <br>
                    If there is a spice that Sri Lanka is particularly famous for, it’d undoubtedly be Cinnamon. 'Ceylon Cinnamon’ is world-renowned for its notable qualities such as unique flavour, colour and aroma in comparison with Cassia. It has been a major spice in Sri Lanka culture for years as a food preservative and later for its natural flavouring properties. <br>
                    These thin brown pieces of bark emanate a sweet fragrance and are commonly found in bakery products, flavoured teas or meat preservation. It is not only an excellent elevator but also an acknowledged health blessing as it possesses medical properties to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. It also contains some anti-inflammatory properties. <br>
                    As Sri Lanka's most important spice export Ceylon Cinnamon not only sees exports in its natural form but is also processed into tablets, powder or essential oils to be exported to major markets, the value and importance placed on Ceylon Cinnamon rank Sri Lanka as the source for 90% of the true cinnamon exported around the world. <br><br>
                    <h2>PEPPER</h2> <br>
                    The king of spice, Pepper has the second-largest spice presence in Sri Lanka and is the largest spice presence in the global market. Obtained from Piper Nigrum vines, this spice is easily recognizable for its sharp aroma and mildly spicy flavour that often let it substitute for chillies. In addition to flavouring, pepper is ripe with medicinal properties and is often used in massages or other natural treatment methods. <br><br>
                    <h2>CURRY LEAVES</h2> <br>
                    Curry leaves or 'Karapincha' as referred to by locals come from a commonplace plant that can be found in almost any Sri Lankan home garden. These freshly plucked leaves give out a strong fragrance when tempered making them an ideal seasoning. <br>
                    As the name suggests, Curry leaves are an excellent addition to curry-based dishes that dominate Sri Lankan and Eastern cuisines. Curry leaves are most effective when freshly plucked, which lead to them being grown in many home gardens bringing a variety of medicinal properties against liver diseases, cholesterol etc. while also lifting the dish's flavours to new heights. <br><br>
                    <h2>PANDAN LEAVES</h2> <br>
                    The Pandan leaves or 'Rampe' belong to a variety of screw-pine plants. The blade-like leaves of this plant possess an intense nutty aroma that makes it an ideal accompaniment for rice or curry-based dishes. Whatever the application, Pandan plants are a simple yet effective means to add aroma and flavour to a dish and are sure to fill your entire kitchen with its exotic fragrance. <br><br>
                    <h2>LEMONGRASS (SERA)</h2> <br>
                    A tropical herb with culinary properties, lemongrass consists of long thick stalks of grass that produce an essential oil with an odour similar to that of lemon which is where its name is derived from. Lemongrass harmonizes meat and savoury dishes making it one of the most widely used herbs in Sri Lankan cooking where its lower bulbous portions are used, pounded or cut into slices. <br>
                    In addition to cooking Lemongrass also acts as a diuretic, tonic or stimulant and exhibits various other medicinal properties, and is even utilized as an insect repellant making it one of the most versatile herbs grown in Sri Lanka. <br><br>
                    <h2>CLOVES (KARAMBUNATTI)</h2> <br>
                    The dried unopened flower buds of an evergreen tree, this spice is easily identified by its incredibly intense spicy aroma and pungent bittersweet flavours. Cloves are an essential spice in Eastern cuisine and are primarily used to flavour and aromatize meat or rice-based dishes. <br>
