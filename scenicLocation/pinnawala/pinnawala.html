                      Sabaragamuwa Province of Sri Lanka. <br>
                      * Pinnawala has the largest herd of captive elephants in the world. <br>
                      * In 2011,there were 96 elephants, including 43 males and 68 females from 3 generations, living in Pinnawala The orphanage was founded to care and protect the many orphaned unweaned wild elephants found wandering in
                       and near the forests of Sri Lanka. <br>
                       * It was established in 1975 by the Sri Lanka Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) 
                        On 31 August 2021, a 25 year old elephant named Surangi gave birth to twin male baby elephants at the orphanage. <br>
                        * It also marked the first instance of the birth of twin elephants in Sri Lanka after a gap of 80 years since 1941
                        <h2 class="content-title">Elephant care</h2>
                       * Young elephants sometimes fall into pits and ravines in their quest for water during drought period. <br>
                       * Other orphans have been displaced from their wild habitat by development projects or have been found abandoned before weaning, diseased or wounded. <br>
                       * There are 48 mahouts (handlers) who take care of the elephants. <br>
                       * The female and young elephants in Pinnawala range freely as a herd during the day in an area of a few acres. <br>
                       * They are herded about .5 km (0.31 mi) twice a day to drink and be bathed in the river. <br>
                       * At night,the females are individually chained in stalls. <br>
                       * Adult males do some light work such as transporting feed. <br>
                       * They are chained and managed individually. <br>
                        * Calves born in Pinnawala are not bottle fed, but a few from ETH are kept at Pinnawala and bottle fed as a tourist attraction. <br>
                       *The elephants are fed in their stalls. <br>
                       * There is very little food they can gather from the premises of the orphanage except some grass. <br>
                       * Large quantities of jackfruit, coconut, kitul (sugar palm), tamarind and grass, brought in daily, form the bulk of the elephants food. <br>
                       * Each adult animal is given around 250 kilograms (550 lb) of this green matter per day and around 2 kg (4.4 lb) from a food bag containing rice bran and maize.
                       

                        <h2 class="content-title">Animal welfare</h2>
                        * Most of the elephants at Pinnawala are healthy and once attaining adulthood, will be retained within the facility mostly since they have become dependent on supplied food. <br>
                        * A few disabled elephants are given residential care. <br>
                        * One tusker, Raja is blind, and one female, named Sama, lost her front right leg to a land mine. <br>
                        * Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage was the subject of a 2010 report by the Born Free Foundation which called into question animal welfare at the orphanage. <br>
                        * Quality of care of elephants who are donated from Pinnawala has been a big public issue. <br>
                        * In 2012 The Sri Lanka Environment Trust spoke out against authorities who continue to 'donate' tamed elephants to people who had 'poor' past records of taking care of animals. <br>
                        * "There are enough cases to show that the authorities are releasing elephants from Pinnawala to the same group of people who don't take care of the animals. <br>
                        * " Despite these accusations it is proven that the surveillance is done by the fact that four of such donated elephants by presidential decree being returned to the elephant by a court order.
